## Pre-Requisites

1.  Azure account linked to a Work or School Account (previously, Organizational Account).  Please follow the instructions [here](PASS_SETUP.md) to set up an Azure Pass using the code assigned to you after registration AND the proper email (for instructor-led format).  The best email will be a Work or School Account, but a Microsoft Account may be used, it just might have limitations during the training.

2.  Power BI online account - Power BI online requires an **organizational/work email** (sign-in or sign-up [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/landing/signin/)).  If you only have a Microsoft Account (not organizational/work related), it is recommended you get a trial Office 365 account [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Sign-up-for-a-free-Office-365-for-business-trial-f340d012-ad0f-4b13-b539-8b160f3e9644) and sign up for Power BI online with that.

3.  Visual Studio 2015 Desktop (Community Edition is fine) - Please ensure you install with:
  * SQL Server Data Tools or download separately [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt204009.aspx).
  * R Tools for Visual Studio or download separately [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/rtvs/)

4.  Check Azure credits by visiting the Management Portal at http://manage.windowsazure.com.
